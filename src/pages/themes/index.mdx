# Theme 

import Themes from './Themes'

Users can use themes to change and customize the looking of their Gosling visualizations.

## How to Use

```javascript
import { Themes, getTheme } from 'gosling-theme';
import { GoslingComponent } from 'gosling.js';

<GoslingComponent spec={spec} theme={Themes.dark}>

// or

<GoslingComponent spec={spec} theme={getTheme('dark')}>

// or just

<GoslingComponent spec={spec} theme={'dark'}>

// to modify an existing theme

<GoslingComponent spec={spec} theme={{base: 'dark', axis: { baselineColor: 'green' }}>

// to modify an existing theme

<GoslingComponent spec={spec} theme={{root: {background: 'black'}, axis: { baselineColor: 'green' }}>

```
## Theme Playground
In the Theme Playground below, you can explore a set of themes that are currently supported in Gosling.
You can also customize the theme by changing the theme specification in the code editor. 
The visualization will be automatically updated.
