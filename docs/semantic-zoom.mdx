Advanced zooming technique, called Semantic Zooming, allows users to dynamically switch between visual representations upon zooming in and out. 

For example, detailed information of nucleotide bases can be shown with textual labels when zoomed in while it can be switched to show the overall distribution of the bases using a stacked bar chart when zoomed out.


Semantic zoom is achieved by controlling `alignment` and `visibility`.
<a href="http://gosling-lang.org/docs/composition#align-multiple-tracks-in-one-view" target="_blank">alignment</a> allow users to overlap multiple marks on top of one other, thus allowing users to create different visualizations for the same data.
`visibility` controls the visibility of visual marks, thus allowing the switch between different visualizations based on the zoom level.


The `visibility` of corresponding marks are decided by whether the `measure` of `target` and the `threshold` satisfy the specified `operation`.
For example, in the code below, text marks only show when the width (`measure`) of the mark (`target`) is greater-than (`operation`) 20 (`threshold`).

```javascript
{
  // example of semantic zoom: show text marks when zooming in

  "tracks":[{
    "data":...,
    "x": ...,
    "y": ...,
    // overlay overlaps bar marks and text marks for the same data
    "alignment": "overlay",
    "tracks":[
      //a track with bar marks always shows
      {
        "mark": "bar",
        ...
      },
      //a track with text marks only shows when the width of mark is greater than 20 
      {
        "mark": "text",
        "visibility": [{
          "operation": "greater-than",
          "measure": "width",
          "threshold": "20",
          "target": "mark"
        }] 
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

Gosling supports users in controlling the visibility based on either 
the size of the specified target (`{"measure": "width"|"height"}`) 
or the zoom level of the specified target (`{"measure": "zoomLevel"}`).

## Control Visibility through Size
<TableWrapper objName='SizeVisibilityCondition' />

## Control Visibility through Zoom Level
<TableWrapper objName='ZoomLevelVisibilityCondition' />


## Example: Sequence Visualization
<img src="/img/doc_images/semantic_zoom_1.png" alt="semantic_zoom_fine" width="700"/>

<img src="/img/doc_images/semantic_zoom_0.png" alt="semantic_zoom_coarse" width="700"/>

## Example: Cyto Band
<img src="/img/doc_images/semantic_zoom_2.png" alt="semantic_zoom_coarse" height="60" width="700"/>  

<img src="/img/doc_images/semantic_zoom_3.png" alt="semantic_zoom_fine" height="60" width="700"/> 

**Top**: only `rect` marks are represented; **Bottom:** `text` and `triangle` marks are presented when zooming in to show more details.
