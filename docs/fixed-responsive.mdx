Gosling visualizations can be responsive or fixed to the screen size.

## Responsive size
A Gosling visualization can be made responsive to the screen size by setting the `responsiveSize` property in the root of the Gosling specification. When the screen size changes, the visualization will automatically adjust its size to fit the screen.

Here is an example of a Gosling specification with responsive size enabled:

```javascript
{
  // highlight-start
  responsiveSize: { width: true },
  // highlight-end
  // ... rest of the Gosling spec
}
```

## Fixed size

A Gosling visualization can have a fixed size by setting the `width` and `height` properties. The tracks will have a fixed size regardless of the screen size.

When the `width` and `height` properties are set in the root of the spec, all tracks will have this height and width unless they are overridden in the track specification.

```javascript
{
  // highlight-start
  width: 800,
  height: 200,
  // highlight-end
  // ... rest of the Gosling spec
}
```
