# Integrating Non-Gosling Visualizations

You may want to visualize a non-Gosling visualization **within** a Gosling visualization, such as showing a lineage tree along with multiple sequences.

In Gosling, you can do this by using `DummyTrack` as a placeholder to create space for your non-Gosling visualization. 
Your non-Gosling visualization can then be overlaid on top of the `DummyTrack` using [JS API functions](js-api) to 
get the position of the placeholder.

:::caution
`DummyTrack` can only be used with a linear `layout` at the moment.

:::
You can also find another example of using Gosling with [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) at https://github.com/gosling-lang/gosling-react-example

[DummyTrack demo in the Editor](https://gosling-lang.github.io/gosling.js/?example=doc_dummy_track)

Here's a `DummyTrack` specification example
```javascript
"tracks": [
    {
      "type": "dummy-track",
      "title": "Placeholder",
      "id": "my_track",
      "height": 200,
      "width": 300,
      "style": {"background": "#e6e6e6", "textFontSize": 8, "textFontWeight": "normal"}
    }
],

```

`DummyTrack` properties: 
<TableWrapper objName='DummyTrack' GoslingSchema={GoslingSchema} />

`DummyTrack` has a `style` property which can take an object with the following properties:

<TableWrapper objName='DummyTrackStyle' GoslingSchema={GoslingSchema} />
