## :pushpin: Abstract
Most existing genomic visualization tools are tailored toward specific use cases, lacking the generalizability for reuse and expressivity to build interactive visualizations that scale to the diverse data types and analysis tasks in genomics. The **Gosling visualization grammar for genome-mapped data** (http://gosling-lang.org, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34596551) defines primitives that specify how genomics datasets can be transformed and mapped to visual properties, providing building-blocks to compose unique scalable and interactive genomics data visualizations on the web. 
The **Gos Python library** (https://gosling-lang.github.io/gos/) is designed to enable computational biologists to quickly author Gosling-based visualizations with their own data. 

**In our tutorial, we introduce core concepts of genomic data visualizations and illustrate how they can be applied through hands-on training with Gos in Jupyter Notebooks.**

## :card_index_dividers: Tutorial Info
The tutorial will be held at the ISMB 2022 conference, July 10-14, 2022. Details will be announced in Spring 2022.
** The tutorial slides and materials for hands-on exercises (e.g., code implementation, datasets) will be posted on this website **.


The content and exercise in this tutorial are designed to be engaging and accessible to a broad audience ranging from visualization beginners to experts. 
This tutorial will be most beneficial for biologists working on genomics-related topics and software developers in bioinformatics, 
especially those interested in creating flexible, scalable, and interactive visualizations.

The audience is expected to have a basic understanding about genomics data and practical knowledge of Python programming. 
Some prior experience with technologies like JSON and JavaScript is helpful for the “Applications” session but not required.
