In <a href='./create-multi-track-visualization'>Tutorial 2</a>, we introduce how to create a multi-track visualization, as shown below.

<GoslingComponent spec={stripJsonComments(SPEC_CIRCULAR)} padding={20}/>


In Gosling, we call a visualization with several `tracks` as **a single view**.
Sometimes, we may wish to create a visualization with **multiple views**, e.g., one overview + several detailed views.

## Create Multiple Views

Let's say we use the above circular visualization as the overview that visualizes all the chromosomes. 
To achieve this, we remove the specified `x.domain` in the overview.


```diff
# **remove the domain specification in overview**
-  "domain": {"chromosome": "1"},
```

We then create two linear detailed views for two different chromosomes, e.g., chromosome 2 and chromosome 5.


**Detailed View 1**

<GoslingEditor spec={SPEC_DETAIL} />


**Detailed View 2** is the same as **Detailed View 1** except the `x.domain`.

```diff
-  "domain": {"chromosome": "2"}
+  "domain": {"chromosome": "5"}
```


## Arrange Multiple Views
So far, we have created one overview and two detailed views.
In Gosling, multiple views can be arranged using the <a  href='/docs/composition#arrange-multiple-views' >`arrangement`</a> property.

```javascript
{
    "arrangement": "parallel"
    "views": [
        {/** overview **/},
        {
            "arrangement": "serial",
            "spacing": 20,
            "views": [
                {/** detailed view 1 **/},
                {/** detailed view 2 **/}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```



## Link Multiple Views
We need to <a href='/docs/user-interaction#linking-views' target='_blank'>link</a> the overview and the two detailed views.
We overlay two `brush` objects to the overview, and link the two `brush` objects to the two detailed views using `linkingId` (i.e., "detail-1", "detail-2").
To help users visually link the brush objects and the detailed views, we assign the same color to the `brush` in the overview and the `background` of the corresponding detailed view.


```diff
# **add two brushes to the overview**
+ "alignment": "overlay",
+ "tracks": [
+    {
+        "mark": "area"
+    },
+    {
+        "mark": "brush",
+        "x": {
+            "linkingId": "detail-1"
+        },
+        "color": {
+            "value": "blue"
+        }
+    },
+    {
+        "mark": "brush",
+        "x": {
+            "linkingId": "detail-2"
+        },
+        "color": {
+            "value": "red"
+        }
+    }
+ ]
```


```diff
# **link detail view 1 to the first brush**
+  "linkingId": "detail-1",

+  "style": {
+     "background": "blue",
+     "backgroundOpacity": 0.1
+  }
```


```diff
# **link detail view 2 to the second brush**
+  "linkingId": "detail-2",

+  "style": {
+     "background": "red",
+     "backgroundOpacity": 0.1
+  }
```
