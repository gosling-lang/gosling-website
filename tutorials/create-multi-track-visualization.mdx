In <a href='./'>Tutorial 1</a>, we introduce how to load data, encode data with marks, transform data, overlay multiple marks and obtain the following visualization.

<BrowserGosling spec={SPEC_OVERLAP} />


This tutorial continues from this example and introduces more advances functions: 
- [Semantic Zooming](#semantic-zooming)
- [Multiple Linked Tracks](#multiple-linked-tracks)
- [Circular Layout](#circular-layout)


## Semantic Zooming

Apart from the default zoom and pan interactions, [semantic zoom](https://github.com/gosling-lang/gosling-docs/blob/master/docs/semantic-zoom.md) is supported in Gosling and allows users to switch between different visualizations of the same data through zooming in/out. When zooming in, the same data will be represented in a different way in which more details are shown. 

Let's say, for this visualization, we want text annotations to show up when zooming in.
We add `text` marks to the `overlay` property and specify when the `text` marks should appear through the `visibility` property.
We may wish the text marks to appear when the distance between chromStart and chromEnd is big enough to place a text mark.
In other words, the text marks appear when the width (`measure`) of the text mark (`target`) is less than (`operation`) than `|xe-x|`.

## Multiple Linked Tracks

We may wish to represent the same data from different aspects using different types of visualization.
To achieve this, we add an area chart (i.e., a new `track`) to the `tracks` property. 
Since these tracks share the same `x` coordinate, we wish to link these two tracks: the zooming and panning performed in one track will be automatically applied to the linked track.  
In Gosling, `tracks` can be linked by assigning `x` the same  `linkingId`.

## Circular Layout

We can easily turn the visualization into a circular layout through the `layout` property.
